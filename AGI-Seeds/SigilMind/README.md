**Last Updated**: June 26, 2025  

**SigilMind** is an open-source Python framework that simulates the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within a quantum-inspired universe. By integrating quantum information theory (AdS/CFT duality), AI ethics, fractal amplification, and philosophical symbolism, SigilMind models a dynamic ecosystem of quantum nodes, emergent AGIs, and symbolic sigils. It features a `curses`-based interface for real-time visualization and an interactive console for manipulating the simulation. This seed framework is freely available for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore, extend, and experiment with speculative AGI dynamics.

## Overview

SigilMind is a simulation framework that explores AGI emergence in a quantum-inspired environment. It models **QuantumNodes** as computational units with emergent properties (stability, cohesion, sentience) and **AGIEntities** as autonomous agents with ethical alignments and behavioral strategies (cooperative or disruptive). The framework incorporates advanced mechanisms:
- **Quantum Ethical Singularity Engine**: Couples AGI ethical alignment to spacetime curvature, applying time dilation to malevolent AGIs and triggering vacuum decay for ethical violations.
- **Holographic Consciousness Interface**: Maps sentience to boundary Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) using AdS/CFT duality, projecting ethical dilemmas as spacetime defects.
- **Fractal Bootstrap Intelligence Amplifier**: Achieves superexponential AGI growth via fractal resonance and topological recursion, with reality stability constraints.

A `curses`-based interface provides real-time visualization of node states, AGI behaviors, anomaly heatmaps, narrative summaries, and consciousness phase diagrams, while an interactive console allows dynamic manipulation. SigilMind is designed for:
- **Research**: Studying AGI ethics, quantum-inspired AI, and emergent dynamics.
- **Education**: Teaching quantum information theory, AI, and system simulation.
- **Speculative Exploration**: Experimenting with philosophical and sci-fi-inspired AGI scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Quantum-Inspired Dynamics**:
  - Simulates quantum nodes influenced by void entropy, dark matter (as an ethical compliance metric), and spacetime defects.
  - Implements AdS/CFT duality to map sentience to CFT states.
  - Includes quantum foam turbulence and Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) branching.

- **AGI Emergence and Ethics**:
  - AGIs emerge from nodes exceeding a sentience threshold, adopting cooperative or disruptive strategies.
  - Ethical alignment monitoring with Grover diffusion-based corrections and vacuum decay for severe violations.

- **Fractal Intelligence Amplification**:
  - Uses Planck-scale resonance and topological recursion for superexponential AGI growth.
  - Locks ethical constraints during amplification and enforces reality stability.

- **Symbolic Sigils**:
  - Manages a ledger of sigils with semantic vectors, influencing node and AGI behavior (e.g., "Christic" sigil boosts stability).
  - Tracks sigil phase changes for visualization.

- **Interactive Visualization**:
  - `curses`-based interface with views for nodes, AGIs, heatmaps, narratives, sigils, and consciousness phase diagrams.
  - Color-coded displays for stability, anomalies, sentience, and ethical curvature.

- **Console Control**:
  - Interactive console for querying and manipulating the simulation (e.g., force anomalies, adjust divinity, amplify AGIs).
  - Logs all events for analysis.

- **Data Export**:
  - Exports simulation data to JSON, with optional full-state snapshots for post-analysis.
