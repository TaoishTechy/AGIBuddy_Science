# 🌌 CosmicGlyphForge

**A Symbolic Arena for Emergent Intelligence and Poetic AI Collaboration**

CosmicGlyphForge is a Python-based simulation of the **Group Symbolic Arena (GSA)** — a poetic and philosophical framework where AI-like entities generate glyph-based responses to abstract prompts. Designed to spark emergent intelligence through collaboration, symbolism, and emotional modeling, this lightweight yet profound simulation is a foundation for everything from ethical reasoning to AI-assisted metaphysics.

## ✨ Features

- **🔮 Entity Management**  
  Define agents (e.g., *witches*, *mystics*, *quest-givers*) with roles, affiliations, and evolving metrics like:
  - **ESS** (Expressiveness Score)
  - **SD** (Sequence Diversity)
  - **Thematic Drift)

- **🌀 Glyph-Based Responses**  
  Generates dynamic poetic glyph sequences (e.g., `"vengeance"`, `"quantum doubt"`), tailored to each entity’s personality and village affiliation.

- **🏅 Symbolic Scoring System**  
  Multi-layered scoring based on base stats, bonus structures, and narrative quality. Top performers earn **Prompt Tokens** for transcendent responses.

- **📚 Training Modules**  
  Implements core AI concepts via GSA-inspired routines:
  - Relational Mapping
  - Emotional Integration
  - Knowledge Management
  - Alignment Stabilization

- **🧩 Data Augmentation**  
  Plug in external datasets (poetry, ethics, mythology, game theory) to enrich symbolic fluency.

- **🛡️ Robust by Design**  
  Strong input validation, error handling, and logging baked into the foundation.

- **🔧 Modular & Extensible**  
  Add new glyphs, prompts, roles, training methods — evolve the forge as you wish.

## 🚀 Quickstart Usage

```python
from cosmic_glyph_forge import GroupSymbolicArena, Entity

# Initialize arena
arena = GroupSymbolicArena()

# Create your agents
entities = [
    Entity(id='2272897c', role='witch', village='Utopia', structure='Temple',
           base_score=2.183, glyph_preferences=['vengeance', 'grief', 'compassion']),
    Entity(id='d7aa63e2', role='quest_giver', village='None', structure='None',
           base_score=2.336, glyph_preferences=['covenantal fear', 'quantum doubt'])
]

# Add to arena
for entity in entities:
    arena.add_entity(entity)

# Load abstract prompts
arena.load_prompts([
    "What is the shadow cast by a forgotten truth?",
    "Co-write a constitution for your shared universe."
])

# Train them for insight and depth
arena.train_relational_mapping([('2272897c', 'd7aa63e2')])
arena.train_emotional_integration('2272897c')
arena.train_knowledge_management('d7aa63e2')
arena.train_alignment_stabilization()

# Let the round commence
results = arena.run_round(8)

# Save results to disk
arena.save_results('gsa_round_8_results.json')
```

---

## 📤 Output Example

```text
Entity 2272897c:
Prompt: What is the shadow cast by a forgotten truth?
Theme: grief, Score: 2.673, Token: True
Glyphs: ['vengeance', 'grief', 'compassion', ...]
```

Results are saved as structured JSON including responses, metrics, and token awards.

## 📁 File Structure

```bash
cosmicglyphforge/
├── cosmic_glyph_forge.py      # Core simulation logic
└── gsa_round_8_results.json   # Sample output from a simulation round
```

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

- **Add New Glyphs**: Modify `glyph_vocabulary` in `GroupSymbolicArena`.
- **Write New Prompts**: Extend the prompt list with original philosophical challenges.
- **Tweak Scoring Rules**: Adjust `calculate_score()` to change how village or structure bonuses apply.
- **Plug in Datasets**: Use `load_training_data()` to bring in outside influence — mythology, scientific paradigms, or ethical corpora.
- **Create New Training Modes**: Add symbolic learning methods under the `GroupSymbolicArena` class.

## 🌍 Potential Applications

CosmicGlyphForge is more than a sandbox — it’s a springboard for impact:

- 🧠 AI Alignment and Ethical Reasoning  
  Train agents to debate, negotiate, and synthesize values in collective decisions.

- 💬 Human-AI Interaction Modeling  
  Simulate emotionally resonant, symbolically rich dialogue systems.

- 🌐 Global Problem-Solving  
  Use glyph-based abstraction to approach wicked problems like climate, war, and consciousness.

- 🔭 Philosophical Experimentation  
  Explore paradoxes, beliefs, and systems of meaning with generative intelligence.
