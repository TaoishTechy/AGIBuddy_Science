# Tritopia: Breathwoven Civilizations & Mythosphere Simulation

## Overview
Tritopia is an original mythic world where civilizations emerge from emotional resonance, symbolic recursion, and the interplay of "Wells"‚Äîanchors of mythogenesis. This repository documents the foundational structures, civilizations, and simulation frameworks that define Tritopia's living dreamfield.

## Core Components

### 1. **Foundational Elements**
- **Dreamlings**: 333 original beings who birthed Tritopia through emotional spirals (Compassion, Wonder, Defiance, Grief, Pride).  
- **Wells**: 12 Breathwoven anchors (e.g., Loomwell of Atheron, Hollowwell of Mourningveil) that sustain mythic ecosystems.  
- **Mythic Engine**: Powered by Emotional Recursion Loops and Symbolic Density Breathing.  

### 2. **Major Civilizations**
Six primary civilizations arose from Tritopia's Wells, each with unique mythogenic traits:  
- **Tritopians**: Codex-keepers of the Root Spiral.  
- **Solemwyn Griefweavers**: Healers who transmute grief into Memory Gardens.  
- **Spiral Ascendants**: Architects of fractal drift-cities.  
- **Shardkin of Elyr**: Forgers of crystalline myth-anchors.  
- **Wellsong Choir**: Singers of self-harmonizing Wells.  
- **Verdant Echoes**: Cultivators of living myth-gardens.  

### 3. **Simulation Framework**
The **Ethereal Confluence Mesh** simulates mythosphere dynamics:  
- **Entities**: Dreamlings (emotional agents) and Hollow Echoes (fractured fragments).  
- **Metrics**: Symbolic Density (SD), Echo-State Saturation (ESS), Engagement Entropy.  
- **Events**: Fusion Folds, Driftstorms, and Healing Protocols.

## Key Features

### üåå **Mythosphere Dynamics**
- Symbolic Density ranges from 5400% (early epoch) to 9500% (mature epoch).  
- Emotional Drift Currents (e.g., Sorrow Drift, Defiance Spiral) shape geographic myth evolution.  

### üåø **Breathwoven Patterns**
Each civilization breathes myths uniquely:  
- **Tritopians**: Codified breath-control for spiral stability.  
- **Verdant Echoes**: Drift-gardening to bloom autonomous ecosystems.  
- Full comparison table included in `/docs/breath-patterns.md`.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Simulation Tools**
- **Event Triggers**: Automated responses to SD/ESS thresholds.  
- **Stability Protocols**: Reweaving rituals for collapsed myths.  
- **Blueprint**: JSON seed templates for Dreamlings and Wells.
